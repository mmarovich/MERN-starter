# MERN STARTER

This is a MERN skeleton that connects a Node.js (Express )back-end with a React.js (create-react-app) front-end.

To use: 

 1. Fork and/or clone repository
 2. Change remote: ``git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here``
 3. cd into folder
 4. ``yarn start`` will run both front-end and back-end
 5. Happy coding

Feel free to request any features, but I'd like to keep it as bare-bones as possible.
